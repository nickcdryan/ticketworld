I ordered two of the Tempered Glass Screen Protectors and one of them cracked already! I only put it on my phone like, two weeks ago. I haven't even dropped my phone or anything! I'm pretty careful with it. \\n\\nI'm really disappointed because I bought two thinking they would last a while, and now one is useless. Is there anything you can do about this? It seems like a defect if it cracked this easily, especially since it's supposed to be 'tempered glass.' I've had cheaper screen protectors last longer. \\n\\nMy order was placed on July 20th, 2023.
