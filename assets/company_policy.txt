**1. Return Policy**

[POL-RETURN-001] **Standard Return Period:** TechNest offers a 30-day return policy on most products, starting from the date of purchase. To be eligible for a full refund, returns must be accompanied by the original receipt or proof of purchase (e.g., order confirmation email).

[POL-RETURN-002] **Extended Holiday Return Period:** For purchases made between November 15th and January 31st, we extend the return period to 60 days from the date of purchase. This policy applies to all products that fall under the standard return policy.

[POL-RETURN-003] **Opened Items and Restocking Fee:** Opened items, unless defective, may be subject to a 15% restocking fee. The restocking fee covers the cost of inspecting, repackaging, and potentially discounting the returned item. For example, if you return an opened set of headphones that are fully functional, a 15% restocking fee will be applied.

[POL-RETURN-004] **Defective Items:** Defective items can be returned for a full refund or exchange within the applicable return period (30 or 60 days) without incurring a restocking fee. We may require you to provide evidence of the defect, such as photos or videos.
