I placed an order about ten days ago, and I'm really frustrated with myself because I completely forgot to add an additional item I needed. It was for a Smartphone X Pro Max, and I realized shortly after placing the original order that I should have included it.\n\nIs there any way to add this item to my existing order before it ships? I'd really prefer to get everything together in the same order if possible, to avoid paying for separate shipping and waiting for two different deliveries. I already have the Tablet Basic 10-inch and another Smartphone X Pro Max coming.\n\nPlease let me know if this is something that can still be done. I'm really hoping we can figure this out.\n\nThank you for your time and assistance.\n\nSincerely,\nMichael Davis",

    "body": "Dear Customer Support,\n\nI am writing to you today because I have an issue with an item I received recently. About a couple of weeks ago, I ordered an Ultra-Compact Mini PC, and it arrived as expected. However, when I tried to set it up, I discovered that it is defective.\n\nThe Mini PC powers on, but it consistently fails to boot past the initial manufacturer logo. I've tried all the basic troubleshooting steps I can think of, like checking connections and restarting multiple times, but nothing resolves the issue. It seems to be a fundamental problem with the unit itself.\n\nI am quite frustrated that a new product isn't working right out of the box. I would like to exchange this defective Ultra-Compact Mini PC for a new, working one of the same model. Could you please let me know what the process is for exchanging a faulty item?\n\nThank you for your time and assistance.\n\nSincerely,\nJoshua Bell",

I placed order ORD-20250302-1007 on March 2, 2025, for a Gaming Mouse Pro.\n\nUnfortunately, after using the Gaming Mouse Pro briefly, I've found that it's just not comfortable for my hand and doesn't quite meet my needs for gaming. I'm pretty frustrated because I had high hopes for it, but it's simply not working out.\n\nI understand the item has been opened and used for a short period. Could you please let me know what my options are for returning it?\n\nThank you for your time and assistance.\n\nSincerely,\nOlivia Smith",

I'm writing to you today with a bit of a problem, and I apologize if this is an inconvenience.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, on March 1st, 2025, I ordered a \"Mirrorless Camera Pro\" (Order ID: ORD-20250301-1041). Unfortunately, I seem to have misplaced or lost the receipt for this purchase. It was intended as a gift, and it turns out the recipient already had a similar item.\n\nI would really like to return the \"Mirrorless Camera Pro\", but I'm unsure how to proceed without the physical receipt. Is there any way I can still process a return? I have the camera in its original packaging and it's unopened.\n\nAny guidance you could provide would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you for your time and help.\n\nSincerely,\nVictoria Watson",
