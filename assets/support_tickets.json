My Order ID is ORD-20250504-1009. \n\nThe item I ordered was an EOS Rebel T7 DSLR, which is a significant purchase at $449.00. Unfortunately, it arrived damaged. The camera body has a noticeable dent on the side, and the lens has a deep scratch across the front element. This is very disappointing, especially for such an expensive item.\n\nCould you please advise on the next steps to resolve this shipping issue? I can provide more details or photos if needed.\n\nThank you for your assistance.\n\nSincerely,\nSophia Rodriguez",
