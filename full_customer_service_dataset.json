I ordered two of the Tempered Glass Screen Protectors and one of them cracked already! I only put it on my phone like, two weeks ago. I haven't even dropped my phone or anything! I'm pretty careful with it. \n\nI'm really disappointed because I bought two thinking they would last a while, and now one is useless. Is there anything you can do about this? It seems like a defect if it cracked this easily, especially since it's supposed to be 'tempered glass.' I've had cheaper screen protectors last longer. \n\nMy order was placed on July 20th, 2023. The SKU for the screen protector is CAS-SCR-002.\n\nThanks,\nCharlie Brown",
